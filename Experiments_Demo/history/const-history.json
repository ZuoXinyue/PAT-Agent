There are two owners, they can be in the car, near the car, or far away from the car.\nprocess 2: process name: key_pos, process description: This process models the key's position relative to the car. The key can be in the car, far away from the car, or with one of the two owners.\nprocess 3: process name: door_op, process description: This process models the car door's status. The door can be open, unlocked, or locked.\nprocess 4: process name: motor, process description: This process models the motor in the car. The engine can be turned on and off, the car can start and stop driving, and the fuel is gradually consumed after driving and can be refueled.\nPlease structure your analyzed results in the following JSON format:\n{\n    \"processes\": [\n    {\n        \"processName\": \"Process 1\",\n        \"constants\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"MAX_USERS\",\n            \"value\": \"2\",\n            \"description\": \"Maximum number of users allowed\"\n        }\n        ],\n        \"variables\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"userCount\",\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"possibleValues\": \"0 to MAX_USERS\",\n            \"initialValue\": \"MAX_USERS\",\n            \"description\": \"Current number of active users\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"positions\",\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"possibleValues\": \"NEAR,FAR,IN\",\n            \"initialValue\": \"[FAR,FAR]\",\n            \"description\": \"Positions of the two users\"\n        }\n        ]\n    }\n    ]\n}\n\nRequirements for the content:\n1. For constants, they have 3 properties: name, value (should be an integer), and description. For variables, they have 4 properties: name, type (integer, array, etc.), possible values (**please ensure the possible values are defined as constants if necessary**), and description.\n2. Constants should be defined before variables. The names of variables and constants (including the possible values of variables) must be unique across all processes and must not conflict with any process name.\n3. The interaction mode for the processes is interleaving. If the mode is \"none\" or \"choice\", note that constants and variables are likely to overlap significantly across processes. In such cases, ensure that shared constants and variables are defined only once - under the first process - and not duplicated in each individual process.\n4. Initial values should be specified based on commonsense or process description.\n5. Types of variables should be either int or array. If a variable is an array, it is **MANDATORY** to specify its initial value as a list (i.e., the initialValue field cannot be left empty). If no initial value can be reasonably assigned, it indicates that the **possible values are incomplete** and should include additional entries (e.g., it may be necessary to define a value like \"disk_empty\").\n6. The possible values of a variable should be listed out as concrete values separated by \",\" without \"[]\". For example: \"ENGINE_OFF, ENGINE_ON\". It **should not involve any natural language description** (i.e., cannot be something like 0 to MAX_CROSSING_TIME), each possible value **MUST be either a defined constant or a number**.\n7. Descriptions should be clear and concise.\n8. For processName, please follow exactly the processName entered by the user without any additional natural language description.\n9. Variables whose possible values represent actions, transitions, or system control (e.g., moveSelection, activeControl) rather than data states **should not** be included as variables. These are part of the system behavior and will be handled separately during action extraction.\n\nPlease ensure your response is a valid JSON string that can be parsed directly.",

For constants, they have 3 properties: name, value (should be an integer), and description. For variables, they have 4 properties: name, type (integer, array, etc.), possible values (**please ensure the possible values are defined as constants if necessary**), and description.\n2. Constants should be defined before variables. The names of variables and constants (including the possible values of variables) must be unique across all processes and must not conflict with any process name.\n3. The interaction mode for the processes is processes motor, door_op, key_pos, owner_pos, and window interleave each other and interrupted by a process: (water_sensor_high -> submerge -> Stop). If the mode is \"none\" or \"choice\", note that constants and variables are likely to overlap significantly across processes. In such cases, ensure that shared constants and variables are defined only once - under the first process - and not duplicated in each individual process.\n4. Initial values should be specified based on commonsense or process description.\n5. Types of variables should be either int or array. If a variable is an array, it is **MANDATORY** to specify its initial value as a list (i.e., the initialValue field cannot be left empty). If no initial value can be reasonably assigned, it indicates that the **possible values are incomplete** and should include additional entries (e.g., it may be necessary to define a value like \"disk_empty\").\n6. The possible values of a variable should be listed out as concrete values separated by \",\" without \"[]\". For example: \"ENGINE_OFF, ENGINE_ON\". It **should not involve any natural language description** (i.e., cannot be something like 0 to MAX_CROSSING_TIME), each possible value **MUST be either a defined constant or a number**.\n7. Descriptions should be clear and concise.\n8. For processName, please follow exactly the processName entered by the user without any additional natural language description.\n9. Variables whose possible values represent actions, transitions, or system control (e.g., moveSelection, activeControl) rather than data states **should not** be included as variables. These are part of the system behavior and will be handled separately during action extraction.\n\nPlease ensure your response is a valid JSON string that can be parsed directly.",
