Assertion: Register() |= []( read_inv-><>( read_res.0|| read_res.1|| read_res.2|| read_res.3|| read_res.4))
********Verification Result********
The Assertion (Register() |= []( read_inv-><>( read_res.0|| read_res.1|| read_res.2|| read_res.3|| read_res.4))) is NOT valid.
A counterexample is presented as follows.
<init -> write_inv.3 -> t -> [if((2 >= 0))] -> t -> [if((1 >= 0))] -> t -> [if((0 >= 0))] -> t -> [if!((-1 >= 0))] -> write_res -> write_inv.4 -> t -> [if((3 >= 0))] -> read_inv -> [if!((B[0] == 1))] -> [if!((B[1] == 1))] -> [if!((B[2] == 1))] -> [if((B[3] == 1))] -> [if!((B[2] == 1))] -> [if!((B[1] == 1))] -> [if!((B[0] == 1))] -> t -> t -> [if((2 >= 0))] -> t -> [if((1 >= 0))] -> t -> [if((0 >= 0))] -> t -> [if!((-1 >= 0))] -> write_res -> write_inv.4 -> t -> [if((3 >= 0))] -> read_inv -> [if!((B[0] == 1))] -> [if!((B[1] == 1))] -> [if!((B[2] == 1))] -> [if!((B[3] == 1))] -> [if((B[4] == 1))] -> [if!((B[3] == 1))] -> [if!((B[2] == 1))] -> [if!((B[1] == 1))] -> [if!((B[0] == 1))] -> t -> read_inv -> [if!((B[0] == 1))] -> [if!((B[1] == 1))] -> [if!((B[2] == 1))] -> [if!((B[3] == 1))] -> [if((B[4] == 1))] -> [if!((B[3] == 1))] -> [if!((B[2] == 1))] -> [if!((B[1] == 1))] -> [if!((B[0] == 1))] -> t -> t -> ([if((2 >= 0))] -> t -> [if((1 >= 0))] -> t -> [if((0 >= 0))] -> t -> [if!((-1 >= 0))] -> write_res -> write_inv.4 -> t -> [if((3 >= 0))] -> t)*>
